Employee Payment Calculator
This project is a simple employee payment calculator that takes a list of employees and their work hours as input, and calculates the amount to pay each employee based on their work schedule.

Getting Started
To use this calculator, simply provide a text file called input.txt containing the work schedules for each employee, in the following format:

[Employee Name]=[Work Schedule]


The Work Schedule consists of one or more comma-separated time intervals, each with a day of the week (represented by its first two letters), a start time, and an end time. For example:
RENE=MO10:00-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH01:00-03:00,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00

The calculator will output the amount to pay each employee, in USD.

Running the Calculator
To run the calculator, simply run the test.py script in your Python interpreter:
python test.py

This will read the input.txt file, calculate the payment for each employee, and output the results to the console.

Running the Tests
To run the test cases for this project, run the test_calculator.py script in your Python interpreter:
python test_calculator.py

This will run a series of tests to verify that the payment calculator is working correctly.
